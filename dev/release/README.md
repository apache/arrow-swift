# Release

## Overview

1. Test the revision to be released
2. Prepare RC and vote (detailed later)
3. Publish (detailed later)
4. Announce the new release on the mailing list (detailed later)
5. Announce the new release on social media (detailed later)

## Prepare release environment

This step is needed only when you act as a release manager the first time.

We use the following variables in multiple steps:

* `GH_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token to automate GitHub related
  operations
* `GPG_KEY_ID`: PGP key ID that is used for signing official artifacts
  by GnuPG

We use `dev/release/.env` to share these variables in multiple
steps. You can use `dev/release/.env.example` as a template:

```console
$ cp dev/release/.env{.example,}
$ chmod go-r dev/release/.env
$ editor dev/release/.env
```

See
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
how to prepare GitHub personal access token for `GH_TOKEN`.

Note that you also need to install `gh` command because our scripts
use `gh` command to use GitHub API. See
https://github.com/cli/cli#installation how to install `gh`
command.

If you don't have a PGP key for `GPG_KEY_ID`, see
https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#genegrate how to
generate your PGP key.

Your PGP key must be registered to the followings:

  * https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow/KEYS
  * https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/arrow/KEYS

See the header comment of them how to add a PGP key.

Apache arrow committers can update them by Subversion client with
their ASF account. e.g.:

```console
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow
$ cd arrow
$ head KEYS
(This shows how to update KEYS)
$ svn ci KEYS
```

## Prepare RC and vote

You can use `dev/release/release_rc.sh`.

Requirements to run `release_rc.sh`:

* You must be an Apache Arrow committer or PMC member
* You must prepare your PGP key for signing

Run `dev/release/release_rc.sh` on a working copy of
`git@github.com:apache/arrow-swift` not your fork:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:apache/arrow-swift.git
$ cd arrow-swift
$ dev/release/release_rc.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
(Send a vote email to dev@arrow.apache.org.
 You can use a draft shown by release_rc.sh for the email.)
```

Here is an example to release 21.0.0 RC0:

```console
$ dev/release/release_rc.sh 21.0.0 0
```

The arguments of `release_rc.sh` are the version and the RC number. If
RC0 has a problem, we'll increment the RC number such as RC1, RC2 and
so on.

## Publish

We need to do the followings to publish a new release:

* Publish the source archive to apache.org

Run `dev/release/release.sh` on a working copy of
`git@github.com:apache/arrow-swift` not your fork to publish the
source archive to apache.org:

```console
$ dev/release/release.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

Here is an example to release 21.0.0 RC0:

```console
$ dev/release/release.sh 21.0.0 0
```

Add the release to ASF's report database via [Apache Committee Report
Helper](https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?arrow).

## Announce the new release on the mailing list

Send an email to "announce@apache.org" from your Apache email, CC'ing
dev@arrow.apache.org/user@arrow.apache.org.  See an [example
post](https://lists.apache.org/thread/bxpt0r8kw0ltgywnylqdroskkt6966z4).

What is Apache Arrow?
---------------------

Apache Arrow is a universal columnar format and multi-language toolbox
for fast data interchange and in-memory analytics. It houses a set of
canonical in-memory representations of flat and hierarchical data
along with multiple language-bindings for structure manipulation. It
also provides low-overhead streaming and batch messaging, zero-copy
interprocess communication (IPC), and vectorized in-memory analytics
libraries.

Please report any feedback to the GitHub repository:
  https://github.com/apache/arrow-swift/issues
  https://github.com/apache/arrow-swift/discussions

Regards,
The Apache Arrow community.
```

## Announce the new release on social media

Make a post on our [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/arrow.apache.org) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apache-arrow/) accounts. (Ask
your fellow PMC members for access if need be, or ask a PMC member to make the
post on your behalf.)  The post should link to the blog post. See [example
BlueSky post](https://bsky.app/profile/arrow.apache.org/post/3lioi6ov5h22d)
and [example LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/apache-arrow_apache-arrow-java-1820-release-activity-7298633716522758144-L71x).

## Verify

We have a script to verify a RC.

You must install the following commands to use the script:

* `curl`
* `go`
* `gpg`
* `shasum` or `sha256sum`/`sha512sum`
* `swift` 5.10 (6.0 or later don't work)
* `tar`

To verify a RC, run the following command line:

```console
$ dev/release/verify_rc.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

Here is an example to verify the release 21.0.0 RC0:

```console
$ dev/release/verify_rc.sh 21.0.0 0
```

If the verification is successful, the message `RC looks good!` is shown.
